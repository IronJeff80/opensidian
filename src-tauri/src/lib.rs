/* opensidian_lib — the PURE parse/normalize modules, split out of the bin so
   fuzz/ (cargo-fuzz) can link them without the tauri runtime. No tauri, no
   window, no global app state lives here. main.rs re-imports each module at
   its crate root (`use opensidian_lib::vaultfs;`), so every existing
   `crate::vaultfs::…` path in the bin resolves to the same code it did before:
   the split moves compilation units, not behaviour. Add a module here ONLY if
   it is tauri-free and a fuzz target needs it. */
